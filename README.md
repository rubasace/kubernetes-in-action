#What's this
This repo containes my own notes on the book _Kubernetes in Action_ by Marko Luksa

The `notes.md` file contains all annotations divided by chapter.

Example yaml files are under the directory `examples`, with a subdirectory per book Chapter

#Utilities
Two `Dockerfile` files are provided. They provide an already setup image for connecting to gcloud with bash completion and some utilities like `kubectx`.
